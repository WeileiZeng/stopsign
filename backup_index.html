        <h3>Games to Play</h3>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="idleLoops/">Idle Loops</a><br>
            My 13th and my most playable and popular game.<br>
            About 4 weeks playtime available.<br>
            <br>
            ~150 hours development time.<br>
            After scripting ItRtG and NGU so much, I wanted to capture that feeling of small tweaks to a complicated process rather than actually playing the complicated process.<br>
            This game is substantially different than my others in number flow as a result, as it's a different perspective on idle games.<br>
            I was far more ambitious with the autogeneration code this time, making it very easy to add actions.<br>
            This is the first time I created a discord community, which ended up being a *massive* deal and taught me a lot.<br>
            I won the 2018 Most Interesting New Mechanic award in /r/incremental_games for this one.

        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="KPWBeta/">King's Perfect War</a><br>
            14th game.<br>
            Still in development, but nearly done.
            <br>
            ~160 hours development time.<br>
            I took all the feedback I got about Loops and made a game trying to address everything. Unfortunately, I made it a little too complicated. It doesn't quite feel like an idle game, even if it still has its merits.<br>
            This is a closed-system game, like Nanospread, where I want additional content to be heavily based on level design. It achieves that very well, but getting to that point takes a bit.<br>
            Easily the best code I've written though, coming off of the feedback/help I got with Loops.
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="Nanospread/">Nanospread</a><br>
            My 11th attempt, and my only one fully posted so far.<br>
            Has about 1 week of playtime, enjoy!<br>
            <br>
            ~80 hours development time. Inspired by the failures of Progress Bar Quest v2.<br>
            Abandoned because the next set of changes require a deep refactoring.<br>
            My first time coding with someone else - there are a few pull requests in the history made by him, and stats is 100% him.<br>
            Got 30k pageviews according to Google Analytics.
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="Terrafold/">Terrafold</a><br>
            My 12th game attempt.<br>
            Has a few days of playtime, but is a bit more confusing than my other games.<br>
            <br>
            ~100 hours development time.<br>
            My attempt to make an idle game with a much longer rebirth cycle.<br>
            It was so long, in fact, that I got bored of coding it before I got to the rebirth cycle.<br>
            Balance issues are also a pain in this game. I just have too many variables.<br>
            The flow of numbers comes from liking the fundamental formula of Nanospread so much that I wanted to experiment with it<br>
            I wanted to add logarithmic-based dynamic graphics in the background, which is why things are so spread out.<br>
            The code is clean, and the idea is ~40 hours away from being wrapped up, so maybe someday.<br>
            EDIT: the code is not clean
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="progressBarQuest3/">Progress Bar Quest v2</a><br>
            Fun with progress bars.<br>
            <br>
            ~35 hours of work or so. This is my sixth game.<br>
            It uses angular.js for the two-way binding.<br>
            Color changes based on the level of each progress bar.<br>
            This is a better attempt at visualizing propagation.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="Pull_of_War/">Pull of War</a><br>
            My most developed game. When you load, you'll be on "Unit Spawning" - click Barracks, then Battle to start the game.<br>
            This game has saving, but no offline progress. It works at full speed in another tab.<br>
            <br>
            I've spent ~100 hours on this total. It is my fourth attempt at a game. <br>
            The idea came from Desert Strike, a custom game in SC2, and other such Tug of War games. <br>
            It uses angular.js, but only for two-way binding - I'm not a fan of the organization that angular brings.<br>
            Many of the graphics are "placeholder". This game is a statement of what I can and cannot do, and I'm no graphics artist.<br>
            The aspect of idle games that I'm focusing on is needing to watch the game in order to know where to spend your money.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="progressBarQuest/">Progress Bar Quest v1</a><br>
            Fun with progress bars, the first attempt.<br>
            This game no saving, and sort-of works in another tab.<br>
            It goes too fast to make sense of things eventually, but doesn't crash.<br>
            <br>
            ~20 hours of work or so. This is my fifth game.<br>
            I saved this because I enjoy the color progression better than the v2.<br>
            It uses angular.js for the two-way binding. This was also my first attempt at passing functions as parameters.<br>
            Colors change based on how much boost a progress bar has. Give 'em more boost for pretty colors.<br>
            This was my attempt at visualizing propagation. It turns out it's terrible at that, but it's a fascinating result regardless.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="square/">Square</a><br>
            A simple idle game with pretty colors.<br>
            This game no saving, and doesn't.<br>
            It lasts infinitely.<br>
            <br>
            ~10 hours of work or so. This is my seventh game.<br>
            I got frustrated with how much work these games take, so I experimented with what the minimum means.<br>
            This is a game with a single button and no numbers.<br>
            I learned a lot about patterns and colors with this. A 5x5 grid works *far* better than a 4x4 or 6x6.<br>
            I've watched this run for longer than I spent time on it. It was a success from that perspective.<br>
            My most "art"-like game. I think it's pretty. No plans for changing it in the future.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="old1/">Incremental Quest</a><br>
            A clicker game.<br>
            This game has saving, and the idle elements work in another tab.<br>
            <br>
            ~40 hours of work or so. This is my first game attempt.<br>
            Using a single .html file and a single .js file, with no libraries whatsoever.<br>
            This was my attempt at creating elements I hadn't seen before in existing games.<br>
            The main goal of coding it was to keep numbers low - costs less than 6 digits - for the duration of play.<br>
            The UI is modeled off of Cookie Clicker.<br>
            I abandoned it because it was too much work to add another piece for not a lot of play.<br>
            I wanted to create guide-rails for play, like Cookie Clicker or AdCap, but I got bored of how much coding that required.<br>
            I learned a *lot* about game making from this.<br>
            Feel free to use an auto-clicker on it. I know I am.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="old2/">Feature Quest</a><br>
            A slow clicker game.<br>
            This game has saving, and the idle elements work in another tab.<br>
            <br>
            ~30 hours of work or so. This is my second game attempt.<br>
            The first upgrade costs 500 resource1_1, so keep clicking "Exert Yourself". More unlocks with more resource1_1.<br>
            The game picks up a lot on the 15000 costing upgrade to unlock Stroll. It has the upgrade price reduction carryover from the first attempt.<br>
            I actually split my javascript into multiple files! I did it poorly though.<br>
            For this game, I wanted to make a clicker that you only needed to click every few seconds, instead of with an auto-clicker.<br>
            This was also an experiment with polynomial growth, and showing less elements to start.<br>
            I wanted it to be a choice between getting X, X^2, or a lesser amount of both. Practice vs Application, if you will.<br>
            Instead I learned that balance is kind of hard to maintain unless the balance is built-in to the game.<br>
            A different lesson I learned here was to build around a theme - my unnamed resources aren't interesting.<br>
            Another lesson is that good pacing takes planning. This game has terrible pacing - it's much too slow.<br>
            Yet another is that explanations might be important: The block that contains Exert Yourself is active play, the block that contains Take it Easy is idle play.<br>
            I abandoned it because it was too much work to add another piece for not a lot of play. Again.<br>
            Feel free to open the console and type resource1_1 += 100000

        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="Scheduling3/">Reap and Sow</a><br>
            ~40 hours.<br>
            My ninth game attempt.<br>
            I like the name, and I like the concept (forced resets), but the execution isn't balanced right. I did lots of experimentation with this concept that I used in future games.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="miner/">Miner</a><br>
            ~30 hours.<br>
            My eighth game attempt. It doesn't have anything worth playing.<br>
            I had a few goals with this one, the biggest being collaboration.
            I recognized that there were a few parts in my games where I didn't need to know anything about the larger game, and could hand it off to someone else.
            So, I got some friends to say they'd try it, and one immediately refactored all the code to look nicer to them. The other made a list of mineral words to incorporate in the far future.
            I didn't like the first guys changes, and the second wasn't very helpful, so I got discouraged and it died. Lesson learned.<br>
            I wanted to make a game with two and only two resources, both visually represented.<br>
            I also wanted to incorporate story elements via upgrades. This never got added.<br>
            It needs to be more complicated in some parts, less complicated in others, so it was off-balance from the start.<br>
            I still like the vision it was supposed to be, but it requires some heavy updates and refactoring to be useful again.<br>
            I'm rather disappointed with how the development of this went.<br>

            <a href="Idiot Quest/">Idiot Quest</a><br>
            ~5 hours.<br>
            My third game attempt. It doesn't have anything worth playing.<br>
            I started this with the goal of using a javascript library - jquery. As it turns out, a single new language isn't enough to make a game.<br>
            I also started arranging my coding to use dynamic creations of graphic elements here.<br>
            I recognized where it was going - too much work to add another piece for not a lot of play. I abandoned it quickly.<br>
